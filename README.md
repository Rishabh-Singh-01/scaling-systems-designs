## System Scaling Solutions & Designs

This repository is dedicated to providing **clear, visual, and well-documented system design assets** related to **scaling systems** and **distributed systems architecture**. Our primary aim is to demystify complex scaling concepts through visual aids and concise explanations, making them accessible for learners, engineers, and interview preparation.

### Current Status / Design Added

The initial design asset currently available is:

* **Consistent Hashing:**
    * **Focus:** A prototype design created from scratch, and then illustrating the mechanics of real **Consistent Hashing**, a technique used to distribute data or requests across a set of servers/nodes efficiently.
    * **Key Concepts:** Visualization of the hash ring, node mapping, key distribution, and the role of **virtual nodes (vnodes)** in mitigating load imbalance during node additions or removals.

### How to View Design Assets

All designs are created using Excalidraw, and their source files are included in the repository. To view or edit a design:

1.  **Download** the specific design asset file  you wish to view from the relevant folder in this repo.
2.  Go to the **Excalidraw Whiteboard** website.
3.  Use the **"Open"** icon  to load the downloaded design asset file into the Excalidraw workspace.
4.  You can now interact with and explore the design!
